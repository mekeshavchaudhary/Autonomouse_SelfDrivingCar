# Autonomouse_SelfDrivingCar
In this project, weâ€™re creating a small-scale self-driving car that maps and navigates its surroundings autonomously using a combination of Raspberry Pi, L298 motor driver, LiDAR, and stereo cameras. To enhance accuracy, we incorporated YOLO for object detection and SLAM for real-time mapping.
